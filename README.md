Java banking application made in Java for my final grade in University.  You can do some basic functionalities of a bank account like a deposit of amount, withdrawal of amount, etc.
It taught me how the OOP works, MVC/Observer patterns, how interfaces works, Polymorphism/Inhertitance etc.

No GUI, only console typing

Visual representation made in  Visual Paradigm - how the whole application should work.
