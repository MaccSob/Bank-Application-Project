Java banking application made in Java for my final grade in University.  You can do some basic functionalities of a bank account like a deposit of amount, withdrawal of amount, etc.
It taught me how the OOP works, MVC/Observer patterns, how interfaces works, Polymorphism/Inhertitance etc.

NO GUI, Only typing commands in console ( e.g withdraw 150 , deposit 250 , balance etc.)

Visual representation made in  Visual Paradigm - how the whole application should work.
